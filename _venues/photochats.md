Photography and silk screen printing were core workshop activities of the community arts movement in the 1970’s and 1980’s. Both of these art forms were seen as modern, politically engaged and accessible.

Having celebrated its 15th anniversary in October 2017, Photochats has built on the tradition of community photography at Chats Palace and offers exhibition production, colour/ black and white photographic printing workshops and high quality traditional darkroom printing facilities.
